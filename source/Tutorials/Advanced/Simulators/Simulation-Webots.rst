Simulation [Webots]
===================

Several robot simulators can be used with ROS 2, such as Gazebo, Webots, etc.
Unlike turtlesim, they provide fairly realistic results relying on physics-based models for robots, sensors, actuators and objects.
Hence, what you observe in simulation is very close to what you will get when transferring your ROS 2 controllers to a real robot.

This set of tutorials will teach you how to configure the Webots simulator with ROS 2.
